A ruby script I put together in the late 1990s to 
parse log files and mail a report to one or more people.
The first 250 lines are so are the engine, followed by an 
example reporting template (that's the part you'll want to
customize).

No magic or DSL goodness, just a quick hack that someone 
might find useful.
